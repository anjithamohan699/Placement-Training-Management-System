# 📚 PLACEMENT & TRAINING MANAGEMENT SYSTEM (PTMS)

The **Placement and Training Management System (PTMS)** is a web-based application designed to **digitize and streamline placement and training processes** within academic institutions.

In many colleges, placement-related activities are still handled manually through paperwork, emails, and phone calls, leading to delays, errors, and poor coordination. PTMS addresses these challenges by offering a **centralized digital platform** for administrators, placement coordinators, and students to manage all placement and training tasks efficiently.
